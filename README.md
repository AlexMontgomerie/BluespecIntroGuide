# Bluespec Intro Guide

This repository contains some information for learning and writing Bluespec (that is, the hardware description language Bluespecâ„¢ SystemVerilog), intended for students of the MIT class 6.004. It was started and mostly written by Kathy Camenzind in Fall 2018. Brian Chen contributed some material, including this README. You can view the [**Intro Guide**](BluespecIntroGuide.md) or the [**Quick Reference**](BluespecQuickReference.md).
